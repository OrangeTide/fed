 #endif
   fed -?            Display a list of commandline options

User interface
 #ifdef TARGET_CURSES
   To access the pull-down menus, press Esc followed by an initial (eg. 
   Esc+F for the 'File' menu), or move the mouse to the top of the screen 
   and click the middle mouse button.
 #else
   To access the pull-down menus, move the mouse to the top of the screen 
   and click on a menu, or press alt followed by an initial (eg. alt+F for 
   the 'File' menu).
 #endif

   Throughout the interface items can be selected by using the arrow keys 
   and pressing Enter, or by double clicking on them, and menus can be 
   cancelled by pressing Esc, clicking the right mouse button, or clicking 
   on the background of the screen outside the menu.

 #ifndef TARGET_CURSES
   If you move the mouse over to the right of the screen a scroll bar will 
   appear, which you can use to quickly navigate through a file.

   Double-clicking on the text performs a function that is set in the 
   'Config/Options' box. By default it selects the word under the mouse 
   pointer. 

 #endif
   Clicking the right mouse button summons a popup menu containing various 
   functions that are set in the 'Config/Options' box. By default this 
   contains 'Cut' and 'Copy' if a block of text is selected, 'Fold' if you 
   clicked on a line which can be folded, 'Browse' and 'Info' if you clicked 
   on a valid word for these functions, 'Match brace' if you clicked on a 
   brace character, and 'Open' if you clicked on a filename string.

Selecting text
   You can select blocks of text by clicking and dragging with the mouse, or 
   by holding down shift while using the cursor movement keys. Pressing Esc 
   will cancel an unwanted selection.

   After marking a block, you can use Tab and Backspace to indent or 
   unindent all the selected text. Typing in new characters will cut the 
   selection to the kill buffer before the new data is inserted.

Files
   'Open' - ctrl+O
      Opens a file, which you can select by either typing in a filename or 
      double-clicking with the mouse. If the file is already open FED will 
      switch to it rather than opening a second copy. You can open multiple 
      files by providing a wildcard file specification.

      As you type in a name FED will attempt to match it with the files on 
      the disk. Press Tab to accept the match. 

      If there is a filename under the cursor when you select the open 
      command (eg. #include "stdio.h"), this name will be used as the 
      default for the file selector. FED will attempt to locate the file 
      both in the current directory and using the INCLUDE environment 
      variable, so you should set INCLUDE to the directory that contains 
      your system header files.

   #ifdef TARGET_CURSES
      If you close the file selector with alt+Enter rather than just Enter, 
   #else
      If you close the file selector with ctrl+Enter rather than just Enter, 
   #endif
      you will be asked whether to open the file in text, binary or hex mode.

      In binary mode, TAB, CR and LF are treated as normal characters rather 
      than being used to format the text. The file can be edited as usual, 
      but the layout of the data on the screen is purely visual since a 
      CR/LF is not added to the end of each line when it is saved or printed.

      In hex mode, each byte is converted to a pair of hex digits when the 
      file is read, and these are converted back to binary data when it is 
      saved.

   'Close' - ctrl+C
      Closes the current file, asking for confirmation if it has changed.

 #if (!defined TARGET_CURSES) && (!defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Print' - ctrl+P
 #else
   'Print'
 #endif
      Prints the current file.

   'View files' - ctrl+V
      Displays a list of all open files, and allows you to switch to one. If 
      an asterisk is displayed by a file, it has been altered since the last 
      save.

   'Next file' - ctrl+N
      Switches to the next open file. Repeatedly pressing ctrl+N without 
      releasing the ctrl key allows you to step through several files.

   'Quit' - ctrl+Q
      Quits from FED, asking for confirmation if any files have been changed.

   'Save and quit' - ctrl+Z
      Saves all modified files and then quits from FED.

The kill buffer
   The kill buffer is a special file (called "kill") which is used by the 
   cut, copy and paste routines, although you can also switch to it and edit 
   it manually if you want. Whenever you cut text from a file, it is moved 
   into the kill buffer. Normally it overwrites the contents of the buffer, 
   but if you perform several identical cut commands without moving the 
   cursor, it is appended instead. If you select a block of text before 
   performing a cut, the entire block will be deleted.

   'Cut' - ctrl+X
      Cuts the current line (or marked block).

   ctrl+D:
      Cuts the word to the right of the cursor (or marked block).

   ctrl+K:
      Cuts from the cursor to the end of the line (or marked block).

   'Copy' - F9
      Copies the selected block of text into the kill buffer.

   'Paste' - ctrl+Y
      Inserts text from the kill buffer into the document. If a block of 
      text is selected it will be replaced with the contents of the kill 
      buffer.

 #ifdef TARGET_DJGPP
   'Clipboard Cut' - altgr+X
      Cuts the marked block to both the internal kill buffer and the system 
      clipboard.

   'Clipboard Copy' - altgr+C or ctrl+F9
 #else
   'Clipboard Copy' - ctrl+F9
 #endif
      Copies the marked block to both the internal kill buffer and the 
      system clipboard.

 #ifdef TARGET_DJGPP
   'Clipboard Paste' - altgr+V or ctrl+F10
 #else
   'Clipboard Paste' - ctrl+F10
 #endif
      Pastes from the system clipboard into both the internal kill buffer 
      and the current document.

Editing commands
 #ifdef TARGET_CURSES
   'Undo' - ctrl+\\
 #else
   'Undo' - ctrl+Backspace
 #endif
      Undoes the most recent alteration. The number of things which can be 
      undone is set in the 'Config/Options' box (the default is 16 actions). 
      Very large block cut/paste operations may overflow the undo buffer 
      limit, so they cannot be undone.

   'Redo' - F10
      Redoes a previously undone action.

   'Lower case' - ctrl+L
      Converts the word to the right of the cursor to lower case.

   'Upper case' - ctrl+U
      Converts the word to the right of the cursor to upper case.

 #if (defined TARGET_CURSES) || (defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Binary char' - ctrl+Insert
 #else
   'Binary char' - ctrl+I
 #endif
      Inserts an extended ascii character, which you can select with the 
      mouse, the arrow keys, or by typing a two digit hex number.

   'Transpose' - ctrl+T
      Swaps the two characters under the cursor.

   'Auto indent' - ctrl+A
      Toggles automatic indentation on or off.

   'Wordwrap' - F5
      Sets the wordwrap column (set it to 0 to turn wordwrap off). FED will 
      only wordwrap lines that have a trailing space, which works fine if 
      you just type in text and let it wrap at the end of the line, but 
      means you have to be careful not to accidentally delete the space.

   'Reformat' - ctrl+R
      Forces an immediate reformat of the current line (does nothing if 
      wordwrap is turned off).

Cursor position
   'Info display' - F2
      Displays the number of lines, words, characters, and bytes in the 
      file, the current cursor position, and the hex and decimal values of 
      the character under the cursor.

   'Goto line' - ctrl+G
      Moves the cursor to a specified line number in the file.

   'Remember position' - F8
      Stores the cursor location and the name of the file being edited, so 
      you can later return to the position.

   'Last position' - ctrl+F8
      Returns to a previously stored location.

 #if (defined TARGET_CURSES) || (defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Match brace' - ctrl+P
 #else
   'Match brace' - ctrl+M
 #endif
      Finds the brace matching the one under the cursor.

Searching
   'Search/replace' - ctrl+S
      Performs a search using the mode set by the 'Config/Search mode' 
      command. FED searches incrementally, which means that it attempts to 
      find a string matching the search pattern as you type it in. You can 
      press backspace if you make a mistake, and use the left and right (or 
      up and down) arrow keys to skip to the next or previous occurrence of 
      the string. To repeat the previous search, press Enter or the 
      right/down arrow key without typing a search string. To search for the 
      word beneath the cursor, press ctrl+S a second time once you are in 
      search mode. To exit from search mode, press Esc or Enter.

      To do a search and replace, after you have entered the search string 
      press ctrl+R. FED will prompt for the replace string, and then work 
      through the file prompting before each replacement is made. Press 'y', 
   #ifdef TARGET_CURSES
      Space or Enter to make the replacement, or alt+Enter to replace all 
   #else
      Space or Enter to make the replacement, or ctrl+Enter to replace all 
   #endif
      occurrences. To skip past a match, press 'n' or use the arrow keys.

 #if (!defined TARGET_CURSES) && (!defined TARGET_WIN)
   'File grep' - numeric keypad '*'
 #else
   'File grep'
 #endif
      This is exactly like a normal search/replace except that FED will 
      prompt you to enter a wildcard file specification, and will then load 
      and search/replace through all the files matching the specification.

Browsing
   A browser file is a special file containing a list of filenames and line 
   numbers, which you can move through with the 'Next' and 'Previous' 
   commands. Browse files are produced by the 'Browse' search command and 
   some of the commands in the 'Tools' menu (providing automatic compiler 
   error location). You can also directly specify a browser file with the -e 
   command line option.

   'Browse' - ctrl+B
      Searches for all occurrences of the word under the cursor, prompting 
      you for the browse string if there is nothing under the cursor, and 
      writing the results into a browser file called "browse". This command 
      uses the keyword based search mode, and will search through all the 
      files that are currently loaded (see 'Config/Options/Browse files' for 
      an explanation of how FED can automatically load the files you want to 
      search).

 #if (defined TARGET_CURSES) || (defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Next (browse)' - ctrl+down
 #else
   'Next (browse)' - numeric keypad '+'
 #endif
      Goes to the next entry in the browser file. Displays a message in the 
      format:

	    Name of the file
	      |
       Current|browse entry   Browse string or error message
	 |    |                |
      ---+----+----------------+------
      | [x/y] filename.ext:l: <text> |
      -----+---------------+----------
	   |               |
	 Total entries   Line number within the file

 #if (defined TARGET_CURSES) || (defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Previous (browse)' - ctrl+up
 #else
   'Previous (browse)' - numeric keypad '-'
 #endif
      Goes to the previous entry in the browser file.

Folding
   This is a feature which allows a section of text to be 'folded' away out 
   of sight and replaced on the display by a single line displayed in a 
   different color (default red). All of the editing functions work across 
   folds, for example cutting a folded line will delete all of the text 
   within the fold.

   'Fold' - ctrl+F
      If a block of text is selected this will fold the block, otherwise it 
      will make or remove a fold starting at the current line. The size of 
      the fold is determined by the indentation of the text. FED will 
      correctly fold most C, C++ and Pascal code, although occasional 
      problems may be caused by erratic indentation. 

   'Expand/collapse' - ctrl+E
      If there are any folds in the current file this removes them, 
      otherwise it folds the entire contents of the file.

Misc
 #if (defined TARGET_CURSES) || (defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Macro record' - ctrl+]
 #else
   'Macro record' - ctrl+[
 #endif
      Starts recording your keystrokes (you can't record mouse movements).

   'Stop recording' - ctrl+]
      Stops the recording.

 #ifdef TARGET_CURSES
   'Play macro' - alt+Enter
 #else
   'Play macro' - ctrl+Enter
 #endif
      Plays back a previously recorded keystrokes sequence.

   'Repeat command' - ctrl+F4
      Repeats the last command a specified number of times. Not all commands 
      can be repeated.

Tools
   This menu contains various external tools, which can be set in the 
   'Config/Options/Edit tools menu' box. The default settings are:

   'Run command' - F3
      Prompts you for an external command and then runs it.

 #ifndef TARGET_CURSES
   'DOS shell' - ctrl+F3
      Brings up a DOS command prompt. Type 'exit' to return to FED.
 #else
   'Shell' - ctrl+F3
      Brings up your command line prompt.
 #endif

   'Make' - F7
 #ifdef TARGET_DJGPP
      Set up for djgpp v2, this runs make.exe, using the redir utility to 
      provide automatic error location.
 #else
      Invokes make in the current directory, redirecting the output to 
      provide automatic error location.
 #endif

   'Compile' - ctrl+F7
 #ifdef TARGET_DJGPP
      Set up for djgpp v2, this runs gcc on the file that is currently being 
      edited, using the redir utility to provide automatic error location.
 #else
      Runs gcc on the file that is currently being edited, redirecting the 
      output to provide automatic error location.
 #endif

 #ifndef TARGET_CURSES
   'Info (libc)' - ctrl+H
      Uses the gnu Info program to provide context sensitive help on the C 
      runtime library function under the cursor. If there is nothing under 
      the cursor, it prompts you for a function name.
 #else
   'Info' - ctrl+F1
      Invokes the Info program to provide context sensitive help on the 
      function under the cursor. If there is nothing under the cursor, it 
      prompts you for a function name.
 #endif

   'Filter' - F4
      Uses an external text filter program to transform the selected text.

   After running an external tool, FED checks to see if there is a file 
   called "_errors_" in the current directory. If there is, it uses it as a 
   browser file. To provide automatic error location, you should set up the 
   tool to redirect error messages into this file. FED should be able to 
   make sense of most error output: if you have problems send me a copy of 
   the output you are trying to process and I will see what I can do.

   To alter the contents of the 'Tools' menu, change the strings in the 
   'Config/Options/Edit tools menu' box. The format of a tool definition is 
   <name>|<cmd>, where <name> is the string to put in the menu and <cmd> is 
   the command to execute when it is selected. The command can contain 
   various special tokens:
      %eVAR%   - replaced by the value of the environment variable VAR

      %h       - suppresses the <press a key> prompt after the command
      %n       - use the tool as a stdin/stdout filter for transforming text
      %N       - transform text from the file _in_ and write it to _out_
      %p       - prompts the user for a string, and inserts it

Config
 #if (!defined TARGET_CURSES) && (!defined TARGET_WIN)
   'Display mode'
      Changes the display mode.

 #endif
   'Search mode' - F6
      Changes the search mode between relaxed ("ABC" matches "abc" and 
      "subABCstrings"), case sensitive ("ABC" matches "subABCstrings" but 
      not "abc") and keyword ("ABC" does not match "abc" or "subABCstrings").

   'Tab size'
      Alters the tab size. The default is 4 spaces.

   'Options'
      Alters various configuration options:

      'Screen display options'
	 'Display comments'
	    If set, comments explaining each command are displayed at the 
	    bottom of the screen as you move through the menus.

	 'Display cursor position'
	    If set, information about the current file and cursor position 
	    is displayed at the bottom of the screen, in the format:

		   DOS or Unix text format          Character under cursor
		     |                                 | (hex)
		 Auto|indent is on       Cursor line   |
		   | |                     |           |
	       ----+-+---------------------+-----------+--------
	       | * awd filename.ext - line l - col c - ch (ch) |
	       --+--+--+---------------------------+-------+----
		 |  |  |                           |       |
		File|is|changed             Cursor column  |
		    |  |                                   | (decimal)
	       Wordwrap|is on                       Character under cursor
		       |
		     Name of the file

	 'Display menu bar'
	    If set, the menus are always visible, rather than only appearing 
	    when you move the mouse to the top of the screen or press alt.

	 'Display scroll bar'
	    If set, the scroll bar is always visible, rather than only 
	    appearing when you move the mouse to the right of the screen.

      'Edit tools menu'
	 Customises the tools menu. See the 'Tools' topic for details.

      'Edit right click menu'
	 Customises the popup menu that appears when you click the right 
	 mouse button. You can specify up to 16 functions to include in the 
	 menu, although which ones appear at any given time will depend on 
	 the context in which the right button is clicked.

      'Double click function'
	 This is the function that is executed when the left mouse button is 
	 double-clicked (by default 'select word'). You can change it to 
	 anything you like, eg. 'fold' or 'info'.

      'Auto fold files'
      'Auto indent files'
      'Binary files'
      'Hex mode files'
	 Information about which file types to open in various modes.

      'Browse files'
	 The browse command only searches through the files that are 
	 currently loaded into memory. To save you having to manually load 
	 all the files that you want to search, when you do a browse FED 
	 will automatically load every file in the current directory that 
	 matches these extensions.

      'Wordwrap files'
	 Files with these extensions will be loaded with wordwrap turned on.

      'Wrap at column'
	 The default column at which to wordwrap.

      'Use big cursor'
	 If set, a solid cursor is displayed.

      'Make backups'
	 If set, whenever you save a file the old version is renamed to 
	 *.bak. Even if this is not set the old version is kept with a .bak 
	 extension while the file is being saved, so it can be recovered if 
	 the save fails.

      'Check for changed files'
	 If set, after running an external tool, and periodically in the 
	 background, FED will check whether any of the open files have been 
	 changed by external programs (for example a source control system). 
	 If anything has altered, you will be asked whether you want to 
	 reload it.

      'Strip spaces on save'
	 If set, trailing spaces are removed and multiple spaces are 
	 replaced with tabs when files are saved.

      'Print only ascii chars'
	 If set, extended ascii characters (less than 32 and greater than 
	 126) are replaced with spaces during printing.

      'External tab size'
	 Internally, FED treats tabs as a series of spaces. When loading and 
	 saving files it converts between spaces and tabs as appropriate. 
	 This option allows you to set the tab size used in external text 
	 files. It defaults to 8, which is the normal size of an ascii tab, 
	 but you may need to alter it in order for files formatted with a 
	 different tab size to be displayed correctly.

      'Screensaver delay (mins)'
	 FED has a built-in screensaver. This is the delay before it kicks 
	 in. Set it to zero to turn the screensaver off.

      'Undo levels'
	 The number of operations which are stored in the undo list (default 
	 16). This is local to each file, rather than shared between all 
	 open files.

   'Colors'
      Alter the colors used for normal, selected, and folded text, for the 
      user interface, and for the color syntax highlighting. The language 
      specific syntax highlighting information is in fed.syn. Feel free to 
      edit this, or to contact me if you have any problems getting specific 
      languages to work. I haven't done much testing with anything except C, 
      C++, and 8086 asm, so I would appreciate any information you have 
      about other languages.

   'Key mapping'
      Alter the control keys used by FED. Press the key that you wish to 
      remap, and then select the function that you want it to trigger. Be 
      warned: if you remap a regular key such as 'a' or Space, you won't be 
      able to type that character into your files.

   'Save config'
      Saves the current configuration into fed.cfg. If you don't do this, 
      whatever configuration changes you have made will be lost when you 
      quit from FED. If you ever want to return to the default 
      configuration, just delete fed.cfg.

 #ifdef TARGET_DJGPP
CWSDPMI
   FED is a 32 bit program, and needs a DPMI (Dos Protected Mode Interface) 
   server to access the protected mode features of the 386. This can be 
   provided by an operating system like Windows or OS/2, a memory manager 
   like QEMM or 386MAX, or if you don't have any of these, by CWSDPMI, a 
   free program by Charles Sandmann. To use CWSDPMI, just put it in one of 
   the directories in your path. FED will load it automatically if no other 
   DPMI servers are running.

   If you want to get hold of the source code for CWSDPMI, it is available 
   from any djgpp v2 distribution site (see http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/).

   While I'm here, I'd like to say a big thank you to Charles Sandmann,
   DJ Delorie, the rest of the djgpp development team, all the cool people 
   at GNU, and anyone else who thinks they deserve thanking. DJGPP is a 
   seriously great compiler.
